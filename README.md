Update instructions:

Clone this as a sibling of sharpmake and run UpdateSharpmake.bat

If trying to update from a different directory you can pass additional relative file specifiers.

``UpdateSharpmake.bat``  
The default is: ``batfiledir\..\Sharpmake``.
``UpdateSharpmake.bat ..\..\``  
This form will insert the additional paths before sharpmake:  ``batfiledir\..\..\..\Sharpmake``
